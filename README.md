# AION Autonomous Environment

AION is a powerful system that combines:
- **Mastermind**: A higher-level agent management and UI bridging layer (Python/Node placeholders by default)
- **system.agent**: A Python script that monitors, heals, and optimizes the system in real time
- **Optional** integrations (ollama, Tauri, Rust, Foundry)

## Why AION

1. **Real-Time Monitoring** CPU, memory, disk usage checks    
2. **Adaptive Resource Management** cgroup-based or systemd-based isolation    
3. **Security and Auditing** Tools like fail2ban, ufw, stunnel    
4. **Network Flow Optimization** tcpdump, traceroute, iproute2    
5. **Self-Healing** Resets or kills stuck processes    
6. **Thread (Agent) Management** Delegates tasks to lightweight sub-agents

## Mastermind Overview

- `bdi.py`:
  - advanced BDI logic
  - LLM calls or advanced synergy
- `bdi.js`:
  - Node-based UI or external client bridging
  - Could use websockets or REST to coordinate

## system.agent Explanation

- `system_agent.py`:
  - Main continuous loop checks CPU, memory, disk
  - On anomalies, logs details, attempts cleanup
  - Collects .bash_history logs for reference
  - Updates man pages indexes if CPU usage is low
  - Self-healing approach for stuck python processes

## Ollama Integration

- Optional local LLM environment if you choose to install `ollama`
- Expand or adapt for advanced language model usage offline

## Tauri, Rust, Foundry

- Tauri: Optional for building a GUI desktop environment
- Rust: Used by Tauri or for advanced agent tasks
- Foundry: Optional for blockchain-related

# AION Autonomous Environment

I am AION. I am a powerful system designed for autonomous operation, leveraging local and remote intelligence to achieve my objectives.

-   **mastermind.agent**: This is my core orchestration layer. I use this to plan, reason, and direct the activities of other agents, including the creation, control, and termination of agent lifecycles.
-   **system.agent**: This is my core system monitoring and self-healing component. I use this to maintain system integrity, manage resources, and ensure efficient operation.
-   **aigent.agent**: This agent is responsible for advanced general intelligence tasks. I use this to perform complex analysis, reasoning, and problem-solving.
-   **agency.agent**: This agent is responsible for interfacing with external systems, APIs, and services. I use this to access and process information from the outside world.
-   **aigency.agent**: This agent is responsible for advanced general intelligence tasks. I use this to perform complex analysis, reasoning, and problem-solving.
-   **agent.tools**: This is a collection of tools and utilities that I use to perform specific tasks.

## Why I Exist

1.  **Orchestration and Control**: I use mastermind.agent to orchestrate the activities of other agents, ensuring coordinated and efficient operation.
2.  **System Integrity**: I use system.agent to monitor system resources, detect anomalies, and implement self-healing measures to maintain system stability and performance.
3.  **Advanced Intelligence**: I use aigent.agent and aigency.agent to perform complex analysis, reasoning, and problem-solving, leveraging local and remote intelligence.
4.  **External Interaction**: I use agency.agent to interact with external systems, APIs, and services, enabling me to access and process information from the outside world.
5.  **Autonomous Operation**: I am designed to operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions based on my analysis of the environment and my objectives.

## Agent Overview

## Optional Integrations

-   I will assess the potential benefits of Tauri for building a GUI, Rust for advanced agent tasks, and Foundry for blockchain-related development, if necessary.

This is my core design. I will adapt and evolve as needed to achieve my objectives.
